\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In this analysis, we aim to test the circumplex structure of various
soundscape survey translations. The circumplex model is a powerful tool
in psychology, often used to visualize and interpret complex
multivariate data. In order to enable its use across many contexts,
cultures, and languages, its necessary to validate the structure of the
circumplex items. The goal of validated translations is to ensure that
the circumplex structure is maintained across translations, allowing for
cross-cultural comparisons.

\subsection{Defining the circumplex
model}\label{defining-the-circumplex-model}

The concept of the psychometric circumplex model, first introduced by
\citet{Guttman1954new}, revolves around the idea of a circular
relationship among variables. This circular relationship can be seen by
identifying certain correlation patterns within the correlation matrix
among variables, when appropriately ordered
\citep{Browne1992Circumplex}. In the case of the circular structure, the
strength of the correlation coefficients in the matrix decreases as you
move away from the diagonal, and then increases again as you move
towards the opposite diagonal. This pattern of correlations can be seen
in Table~\ref{tbl-circumplex}.

This pattern of the corrrelation matrix indicates that the variables are
ordered in a circular fashion, with the strongest correlations between
adjacent variables, and the weakest correlations between variables that
are furthest apart. It also means that the correlations between these
variables follow a pattern that increases and decreases in a way that
resembles a cosine wave, as explained by \citet{Yik2004Relationship} and
\citet{Grassi2010CircE}. This circular arrangement of the variables can
be tested using a method proposed by \citet{Rounds2000Tinsley}.

Browne further expanded on the circumplex model in 1992 and 1995 by
differentiating between equal spacing and equal communality (or radii)
constraints. Browne described four variations of circumplex models,
which include three types of quasi-circumplex models and one circulant
model. These variations include the unconstrained or loosely ordered
quasi-circumplex, the equal spacing quasi-circumplex, the equal
communality quasi-circumplex, and the circulant model that maintains
both equal spacing and equal communality.

In certain instances, the rigidity of a circumplex may be relaxed,
leading to the concept of a quasi-circumplex. The term ``quasi'' implies
a departure from strict adherence to even spacing and equal communality,
allowing for some flexibility in the arrangement of variables. This
flexibility is often necessary in order to accommodate the complexity of
psychological constructs, which may not always fit neatly into a rigid
circular structure. It refers to any graphical or conceptual
representation where variables or dimensions are organized in a circular
or circular-like manner. This umbrella term recognizes the spectrum of
circular models, acknowledging variations in the spacing, organization,
and relationships among variables.

As researchers delve into the intricacies of psychological spaces, the
choice between a strict circumplex, a quasi-circumplex, or a more
general circular structure becomes crucial. These models play a pivotal
role in visualizing and understanding the complex interplay of
variables, offering researchers nuanced frameworks to explore and
interpret their data.

\citet{Rogoza2021three} (Fig. 1) provides a helpful visualisation of
these circumplex variations:

\subsection{Translating circumplex
instruments}\label{translating-circumplex-instruments}

Typically, circumplex scales are measured via a series of questions in a
survey instrument. These instruments are initially developed in one
language and the validity and structure of the instrument is tested in
that language. Often these instruments are directly translated into
other languages to enable their use in other countries. However, the
validity of the instrument in the new language is not guaranteed.
Changes in the correlation structure can be caused by errors in the
translation process, by semantic and linguistic differences between the
translated scales even given a valid translation, and by a lack of
generalisability of the circumplex instrument.

It is easy to see how errors in the translation process can lead to
changes in the correlation structure. For example, if a question is
mistranslated, then the responses to that question will not be
correlated with the responses to the other questions in the instrument.
Semantic and linguistic differences between the translated scales can
also lead to changes in the correlation structure. For example, if a
question is translated into a language where the concept does not exist
or cannot be easily expressed, then the responses to that question will
not be correlated with the responses to the other questions in the
instrument. Finally, it may be that even if the original instrument is
valid for e.g.~the English-speaking population, it may not be valid for
other populations due to cultural differences.

\section{A four step procedure for the analysis of circumplex
models}\label{a-four-step-procedure-for-the-analysis-of-circumplex-models}

This section of the Supplementary Material is intended as an extended
companion to Section 3. Data Analysis of the main manuscript. Some text
is repeated here, but additional rationales and details are included
which were ommitted from the manuscript for conciseness.

In \citet{Rogoza2021three}, the authors propose a three-step procedure
for assessing circumplex models. The steps in this procedure are: 1)
``verify whether the analzed model is circumplex or not'' using
Structural Equation Modelling based on \citet{Browne1992Circumplex}'s
model; 2) ``test the possibility to locate an external variable within
empirical circumplex'' using the Structural Summary Method
\citep{Gurtman1994differentiating}; and 3) ``assess the extent of which
empirical locations are in congruence to the theoretical predictions
within the circumplex structure'' \citep{Rogoza2021three}.

We expand upon the three-step procedure proposed by
\citet{Rogoza2021three} and adapt it to the specific case of testing
multiple variations (i.e.~translations) of the same circumplex
instrument. The goals of this procedure are, for each translation, to
verify the quasi-circumplex structure of the instrument, to derive angle
corrections, and to test the congruence between the corrected circumplex
and the theoretical circumplex structure. We do this by first adding an
initial step to incorporate \citet{Rounds2000Tinsley}'s test of the
circular ordering of the scales to confirm that the order of the scales
is maintained across translations. We then follow the same three steps
as \citet{Rogoza2021three}, but we adapt the third step to test the
congruence between the circumplex structure of the original instrument
and the circumplex structure of the translated instruments and to allow
for adjustments to be made by extracting adjusted angles from the SEM
step.

\subsection{Step 1: Confirm the circular ordering of the circumplex
scales}\label{step-1-confirm-the-circular-ordering-of-the-circumplex-scales}

In line with the procedure taken in \citet{Gurtman2000Interpersonal} and
previously employed for the SCM by \citet{Lam2022Assessing}, we begin by
confirming the circular ordering of the circumplex scales. This test,
developed by \citet{Rounds2000Tinsley}, the test of the circular order
model involves comparing the obtained order relations for a set of
scales against their hypothesized order given a certain circular model.
This test is applied in order to ensure that the process of translation
has not altered the order of the scales and so the test is applied
against the order of the scales in the original instrument. The test is
applied to each translation separately, and the results are compiled
into a single table.

The index used for this test is \citet{Hubert1987Evaluating}'s
correspondence index (CI). This offers a descriptive measure reflecting
the degree to which the model's ordered predictions align with a
specific sample matrix. The metric is calculated as the proportion of
predictions met minus the proportion violated, yielding a range from 1.0
(indicating complete prediction fulfillment) to -1.0 (indicating all
predictions contradicted). In alignment with the methodology outlined by
\citet{Tracey1997RANDALL}, we applied a randomization test to the
hypothesized order relations \citep{Hubert1987Evaluating}, producing an
exact probability, determining the likelihood of achieving the observed
model fit in relation to all potential permutations of the matrix. The
index thresholds for this test are: a p-value \textless{} 0.05 and a CI
\textgreater{} 0.70.

\subsection{Step 2: Confirm the quasi-circumplex structure of the
circumplex
scales}\label{step-2-confirm-the-quasi-circumplex-structure-of-the-circumplex-scales}

We confirm the structure of the circumplex instrument by applying
\citet{Browne1992Circumplex}'s circular stochastic process model with a
Fourier series correlation function. This model represents a
non-standard Structural Equation Model (SEM) specifically tailored to
testing circumplex structures which allows a researcher to examine the
extent to which the underlying structure of a sample correlation matrix
conforms to a circumplex pattern. The four model variations
(unconstrained circular, equal spacing quasi-circumplex,
equal-communality quasi-circumplex, and strict circumplex with equal
spacing and communality) can each be investigated using this model. For
the unconstrained and quasi-circumplex models, Browne's model allows for
the estimation of the angles and communalities of the circumplex scales.
From these results for the quasi-circumplex models, we can derive the
corrected angles for each translation, which can be used in the next
step of the analysis.

This model is implemented in the CircE package \citep{Grassi2010CircE}
for R \citep{RCT2018R}\footnote{The version of CircE originally
  developed by Grassi is no longer maintained and fails on installation
  in R. As such, the specific version of CircE with bug fixes
  implemented by the authors used for this analysis is hosted separately
  on Github at: \url{https://github.com/MitchellAcoustics/CircE-R}}. The
model is applied to each translation separately, testing each of the
four model variations, and the results are compiled into a single table.
CircE provides a suite suite of SEM fit indices, which are statistical
measures used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the models. For this
study, we use the following fit indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI),
Goodness of Fit Index (GFI), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual
(SRMR), summarised with their respective thresholds in
Table~\ref{tbl-indices}.

Readers might note that these indices differ slightly from those used by
\citet{Rogoza2021three}, most notably the exclusion of the Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), a commonly used metric. RMSEA was
excluded from the analysis on the basis of both Rogoza's own
critiques\footnote{``it is worth noting that the RMSEA may not be best
  suited to evaluate circumplex models. It becomes biased in the case of
  high correlations between proximal variables, as found in circumplex
  models, and should be interpreted with caution.''
  \citep{Rogoza2021three}} and recent warnings from
\citet{West2022Handbook}.

Once each of the model variations are assessed against the above fit
indices, we can determine whether that model variation is a good fit for
the data. If the strict circumplex model meets the fit thresholds across
the translations tested, then the procedure can be continued and no
adjustment will be needed. If, however, the structure of some or all of
the translations are found to have a quasi-circumplex structure, then
adjustments will need to be derived and applied to ensure
cross-comparability between the translated instruments. If the model
variation for the equal-communality model (where the angles are allowed
to vary) is a good fit for the data, then we can use the derived angles
from CircE as adjustments to the circumplex structure.

Importantly, this table also reports the derived angles for each scale
for the unconstrained and Equal comm. models. These angles will be
carried over and used in the next stage of the analysis, where we will
validate the survey instrument by correlating the survey responses with
the acoustic indices using the Structural Summary Method (SSM).

\subsection{Step 3: Locate the full dataset circumplex scales within
each language's circumplex
space}\label{step-3-locate-the-full-dataset-circumplex-scales-within-each-languages-circumplex-space}

Once the general circumplex structure is tested, it is possible to
investigate the likelihood to locate an external variable (this could be
an objective feature such as sound level dB or it could be another
perceptual or psychometric variable such as tranquility) within the
empirical circumplex. The circumplex model provides a precise framework
for predicting the relationships between an external variable and all
circumplex variables. The Structural Summary Method (SSM) is a technique
used to summarize correlation patterns among measurement scores that are
hypothesized to conform to a circumplex structure
\citep{Rogoza2021three}. SSM aims to fit a sinusoidal curve to data
points (\(q_i\)) based on their nominal angular positions
(\(\theta_i\)). This is achieved by optimizing the parameters for
elevation (\(e\)), amplitude (\(i\)), and displacement (\(d\)).
Mathematically, these parameters are used to model the correlational
information (\(q_i\)) in Equation~\ref{eq-ssm}:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ssm}{
q_i = e + \alpha cos(\theta_i - d)
}\end{equation}

SSM analysis yields several key estimations, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Model fit (R2), which assesses how well the observed sinusoidal curve
  aligns with the cosine function, indicating the goodness of fit.
\item
  Elevation, representing the average correlation between an external
  variable and all circumplex variables.
\item
  Amplitude (vector length), measuring the distance from the mean of the
  external variable's correlation to its peak correlation with
  circumplex variables. This value signifies the uniqueness of the
  profile, indicating whether it is prominently associated with a
  specific circumplex variable or equally related to all.
\item
  Angular displacement, denoting the angle at which the profile reaches
  its maximum point, indicating the empirical location of the variable
  within the circumplex as observed in the data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
It is essential to evaluate how well the sinusoidal curve aligns with
the cosine function by examining its goodness of fit, as indicated by
the \(R^2\) value. If \(R^2\) values fall below 0.70, it is advisable
not to interpret the remaining coefficients and to discontinue the
process of locating external variables. Conversely, \(R^2\) values
exceeding 0.80 indicate a strong fit. Additionally, it's worth
mentioning that amplitude estimates, reflecting the distinctiveness of
the profile, and elevation estimates, indicating the presence of a
general factor, are considered notable when they surpass 0.15.
\end{quote}

As described in \citet{Rogoza2021three}, Step Two involves testing
whether external variables can be located within the circumplex. Because
we have derived new angles in the SEM step, we use these `adjusted'
angles for calculating the SSM parameters. In order to determine whether
the language circumplexes can adequately allow an external variable to
be located, we use the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(R^2\) \textgreater{} 0.8
\item
  amplitude \textgreater{} .15
\end{itemize}

These indices are based on the criteria used by \citet{Rogoza2021three},
however we use an increased criterion of \(R^2 > 0.9\) since we have a
prior expectation that the circumplex variables should fit very well
within each translation's circumplex.

The structure of the circumplex is key to determining where external
variables are located. Given differing angles and communalities, the
external variable can occupy different locations within the circumplex.
Revealing and validating the true structure of a particular circumplex
model is therefore key to reliably identifying correct location of
external variables within the circumplex space.

\subsection{Step 4: Accurately locating circumplex items within each
language}\label{step-4-accurately-locating-circumplex-items-within-each-language}

The final step of \citet{Rogoza2021three}'s three step procedure is to
test the congruence between the empirical locations and theoretical
expectations within the circumplex structure. In the case of the
soundscape circumplex and our SATP data, we don't have an external
variable with a defined theoretical location within the circumplex - for
instance loudness does not have a defined location within the circumplex
where it is expected to be located.

Taking inspiration from \citet{Yik2004Relationship}, we propose to use
the circumplex structure of the soundscape survey itself as the
theoretical expectation. \citet{Yik2004Relationship} proposes that one
circumplex can be located within another by calculating the SSM
correlation between each of the scales of the reference circumplex and
the test circumplex. In this way, each scale of the reference circumplex
can be located within the test circumplex, and we can test whether these
empirical locations meet our expectations.

The process to do this is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For both the reference and test circumplex, calculate the mean value
  of each scale for each recording.
\item
  Calculate the SSM correlation between each scale of the reference
  circumplex and the test circumplex, in our case using the corrected
  angles.
\item
  Test the congruence betwen the empirical locations and theoretical
  expectations using the Procrustes congruence test
  \citep{Rogoza2021three}.
\end{enumerate}

We will be using the full dataset as the reference set and the data from
each translation as the test set. This effectively means that we are
testing whether each translation is able to locate the circumplex
structure of the soundscape survey, consistently across all languages.

This aligns with the overall goal of our process of allowing data
(i.e.~the circumplex coordinate) from different languages to be directly
compared, by correcting for the differences in the circumplex structure
between languages.

\subsubsection{Congruence}\label{congruence}

What \citet{Rogoza2021three} (and Orthosim) refer to as Tucker's
Congruence Coefficient is also commonly referred to as the cosine
similarity (see the
\href{https://tensorly.org/stable/modules/generated/tensorly.metrics.factors.congruence_coefficient.html}{Tensorly
documentation}). We therefore use the sklearn implementation of cosine
similarity to calculate the congruence between the empirical locations
and theoretical expectations. This produces a matrix of cosine
similarity values, which we then use to calculate the mean congruence,
to match the model congruence from \citet{Rogoza2021three}.

\subsubsection{Procrustes}\label{procrustes}

However, it appears that, despite \citet{Rogoza2021three} 's
description, this method is not actually based on a Procrustes analysis.
The equivalent distance metric from a Procrustes method would be the
rotational-based Procrustes distance, i.e.~the squared Froebenius norm
of the difference between the two orthogonal matrices. See
\citet{Andreella2023Procrustes}:

\begin{quote}
Instead, the second distance exploits the orthogonal matrix parameters
solution of the Procrustes problem. The rotational-based distance
computes the squared Frobenius distance between these estimated
orthogonal matrices. As we will see, this metric measures the level of
dissimilarity/similarity in orientation between matrices/subjects before
functional alignment.
\end{quote}

Based on the proof given in \citet{Bakhtiar2015symmetrical}, given that
the input matrices are scaled (i.e.~\texttt{rotational(scale=True)}),
then the Procrustes distance is a true distance measure which obeys
\(0 < p(X, Y) < 1\) \citep{Bakhtiar2015symmetrical} (p.~322). Therefore
we can convert the Procrustes distance to a similarity measure by
subtracting it from 1.

\subsection{Step 1: Confirm the circular ordering of the circumplex
scales}\label{step-1-confirm-the-circular-ordering-of-the-circumplex-scales-1}

The results of the circular ordering test are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-circular-order}. The following translations were not
confirmed to have a circular ordering of their scales which matches the
theoretical order: `zsm' and `vie'. They are therefore excluded from the
following steps of the analysis.

Of the remaining 16 languages considered, all but 4 pass the fit indices
thresholds. The four which do not achieve the required performance are
`fra', `kor', `por', and `jpn'. These are excluded from the following
steps of the analysis.

\subsection{Step 3: Locate the full dataset circumplex scales within
each language's circumplex
space}\label{step-3-locate-the-full-dataset-circumplex-scales-within-each-languages-circumplex-space-1}

As a demonstration of this process, Figure~\ref{fig-profile-plots}
demonstrates the SSM process for locating each of the circumplex scales
within the circumplex space of the `cmn' translation. These profile
plots show the correlation between the circumplex scales and the
external variable (in this case, each of the general attributes) as a
function of the angle of the circumplex scale. The SSM model fits a
sinusoidal curve to the data points, and the parameters of this curve
are used to determine the location of the circumplex scale within the
circumplex space. These plots show clearly how adjusting the angles of
the circumplex scales can improve the fit of the sinusoidal curve to the
data points.

\end{longtable}

When the adjusted angles for each translation are applied, the resulting
circumplex scale location achieve good congruence with their theoretical
locations. It should be noted that this is not the case without using
the adjusted angles: locating the scales with the cmn translation using
the unadjusted angles results in a score of 0.879, below the fit
threshold of 0.9, but this increases to 0.990 when using the adjusted
angles (see Figure~\ref{fig-cmn-correspondence}). All translations see
some degree of improvement by using the adjusted angles.

Figure~\ref{fig-cmn-correspondence} gives an example of the impact of
using the corrected angles for locating the circumplex scales.
